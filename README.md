# FPL Team Selection Agent: fpl-gameweek-guru

An autonomous agent built with the HuggingFace `smolagents` framework to select an optimal Fantasy Premier League team.

## Features
- Selects a 15-player team within a Â£100m budget.
- Limits to 3 players per team.
- Uses form (last 5 games), fixture difficulty (double gameweeks, home/away), and a greedy fallback.
- Incorporates web search via DuckDuckGoSearchTool for injury news and expert insights.
- Chooses a captain based on form and fixture difficulty.
